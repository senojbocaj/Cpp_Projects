# Seam Carving Description
This project consisted of intaking different PPM files that depict images using a set of dimensions on the first line, then a series of 3 numbers per pixels which are the RGB values for the pixel. Then using the dual-gradient energy function we would find the lowest energy pixel in the initial row (uppermost for vertical seam, leftmost for horizontal seam). After that, we would use the same method, but this time only checking the 3 adjacent pixels. This process would be repeated until the entire image was traversed. Finally, the minimum energy seam would be removed in the array then the file would be output with the seam gone. This project included file I/O, dynamic arrays, algorithms, high-level looping methods, and traversing arrays.
